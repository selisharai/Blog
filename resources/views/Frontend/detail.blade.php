                <p class="class">As of my last update in September 2021, Patanjali is an Indian consumer goods company
                    founded by Baba
                    Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna. It is known for producing a wide range of products, including herbal
                    and natural healthcare, personal care, and food products. One of their popular product categories is
                    herbal soaps.
                    Patanjali herbal soaps claim to use natural ingredients and traditional Ayurvedic formulations. They
                    are often marketed as being free from harmful chemicals and synthetic additives. Some of the common
                    variants of Patanjali soaps include neem soap, aloe vera soap, lemon soap, turmeric soap, and many
                    more.
                    Please note that product availability and offerings may have changed since my last update. For the
                    most current information about Patanjali soaps or any other products they offer, I recommend
                    visiting their official website or checking with authorized retail outlets.</p>
